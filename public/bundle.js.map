Использовать интерактив и визуализацию, а также специфику каждой социальной сети для привлечения максимально широкой аудитории.</p><h4>Реализация</h4><p>В основных соцсетях (Facebook, Twitter, Вконтакте, Одноклассники, Instagram) были созданы аккаунты – официальные площадки Паралимпиады. Эксперты Vein Technologies адаптировали стиль подачи под аудиторию каждой сети и разработали рубрики, которые позволили подписчикам аккаунтов проекта взглянуть на паралимпийское движение новыми глазами:</br>— Новости Паралимпиады, расписание соревнований, медальный зачет</br>— Редакционная колонка о людях с ограниченными возможностями, которую вел извеcтный журналист Юрий Болотов (Hopes&Fears, Forbs, Slon.ru)</br>— Рубрика «Поддержим паралимпийцев» со словами поддержки от знаменитостей и KOLs: Ксении Собчак, Натальи Водяновой, Артемия Троицкого, Валерия Тодоровского, Дианы Арбениной, Андрея Макаревича, Юлии Чичериной и т.д.

Игры без преград» стал единственным неофициальным ресурсом, полностью посвященным Паралимпийским играм и максимально полно освещающим их. И единственным местом,  где можно было прочитать подробные рассказы о членах паралимпийской сборной России. Уникальность контента, яркая визуальная подача, активное участие KOLs позволили привлечь внимание большой аудитории пользователей социальных сетей.  Кампания «Поддержим олимпийцев» дала вирусный эффект и дополнительно расширила аудиторию проекта.</p><h4>В итоге</h4><p>— Аккаунт проекта в Facebook набрал более 5 тысяч подписчиков, а его охват превысил 28 тысяч — Количество подписчиков Vkontakte превысило 8,5 тысяч, в Twitter и Instagram – 6 тысяч.</br>— Самым массовым оказался аккаунт в Одноклассниках – около 14 тысяч читателей, охват – более 28 тысяч человек.

Агентством было разработано три концепции конкурсов - “Наша игрушка будущего”, “Образ детства” и “Сделано для детства”, каждый из которых был направлен на взаимодействие и привлечение внимания со стороны одного из выбранных сегментов аудитории.</p><p>Для реализации проекта агентство предложило механику, близкую и понятную для аудитории и вместе с тем доносящую открытость Министерства, его готовность к диалогу с потребителями и производителями. Vein разработал сайт Общероссийских конкурсов, который позволял узнать всю необходимую информацию, подать заявку, посмотреть уже присланные работы, обратиться в службу поддержки. За конкурсантов голосовало авторитетное жюри, сформированное из представителей государственной и общественной власти, а также экспертного сообщества, сформированного при участии агентства. Усилить вовлеченность широкой аудитории было призвано народное голосование в онлайн-формате на сайте.</p><p>Проект широко освещался на всех его этапах в digital и традиционных СМИ, а также в оффлайн-среде (школы, художественные ВУЗы, профессиональные и отраслевые ассоциации). Издания, узнавшие о проекте уже в процессе его реализации, сами выходили на организаторов и стремились стать нашими инфопартнерами.</p><p>Завершающим этапом проекта стала торжественная церемония награждения, которая прошла на Конгрессе индустрии детских товаров в Московском Доме Музыки. Победителей награждали представители общественной и государственной власти, эксперты отрасли. Все победители получили ценные призы: дети - игры и игрушки от российских производителей детских товаров, а также экскурсию на фабрику игрушек, дизайнеры - сертификат на прохождение курса в Британской  Высшей Школе дизайна, производители - съемку ролика-визитки о компании.</p><h4>Результаты проекта</h4><p>Всего в рамках проведения конкурсов было направлено более 600 заявок от детей и их родителей, производителей детских товаров, представителей дизайн-сообщества, за которые проголосовало более 12.000 посетителей сайта.</p><p>Проект вызвал большой интерес со стороны аудитории и, действительно, позволил вовлечь потребителей в диалог с производителями, а также привлечь интерес к индустрии в целом как со стороны детей и их родителей, так и со стороны экспертного сообщества.</p></div>'\n\t}];\n\t\n\texports.default = VeinBox;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 95 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(10);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?

Эксперты Vein Technologies адаптировали стиль подачи под аудиторию каждой сети и разработали рубрики, которые позволили подписчикам аккаунтов проекта взглянуть на паралимпийское движение новыми глазами:</br>— Новости Паралимпиады, расписание соревнований, медальный зачет</br>— Редакционная колонка о людях с ограниченными возможностями, которую вел извеcтный журналист Юрий Болотов (Hopes&Fears, Forbs, Slon.ru)</br>— Рубрика «Поддержим паралимпийцев» со словами поддержки от знаменитостей и KOLs: Ксении Собчак, Натальи Водяновой, Артемия Троицкого, Валерия Тодоровского, Дианы Арбениной, Андрея Макаревича, Юлии Чичериной и т.д.

Агентством было разработано три концепции конкурсов - “Наша игрушка будущего”, “Образ детства” и “Сделано для детства”, каждый из которых был направлен на взаимодействие и привлечение внимания со стороны одного из выбранных сегментов аудитории.</p><p>Для реализации проекта агентство предложило механику, близкую и понятную для аудитории и вместе с тем доносящую открытость Министерства, его готовность к диалогу с потребителями и производителями. Vein разработал сайт Общероссийских конкурсов, который позволял узнать всю необходимую информацию, подать заявку, посмотреть уже присланные работы, обратиться в службу поддержки. За конкурсантов голосовало авторитетное жюри, сформированное из представителей государственной и общественной власти, а также экспертного сообщества, сформированного при участии агентства. Усилить вовлеченность широкой аудитории было призвано народное голосование в онлайн-формате на сайте.</p><p>Проект широко освещался на всех его этапах в digital и традиционных СМИ, а также в оффлайн-среде (школы, художественные ВУЗы, профессиональные и отраслевые ассоциации). Издания, узнавшие о проекте уже в процессе его реализации, сами выходили на организаторов и стремились стать нашими инфопартнерами.</p><p>Завершающим этапом проекта стала торжественная церемония награждения, которая прошла на Конгрессе индустрии детских товаров в Московском Доме Музыки. Победителей награждали представители общественной и государственной власти, эксперты отрасли. Все победители получили ценные призы: дети - игры и игрушки от российских производителей детских товаров, а также экскурсию на фабрику игрушек, дизайнеры - сертификат на прохождение курса в Британской  Высшей Школе дизайна, производители - съемку ролика-визитки о компании.</p><h4>Результаты проекта</h4><p>Всего в рамках проведения конкурсов было направлено более 600 заявок от детей и их родителей, производителей детских товаров, представителей дизайн-сообщества, за которые проголосовало более 12.000 посетителей сайта.</p><p>Проект вызвал большой интерес со стороны аудитории и, действительно, позволил вовлечь потребителей в диалог с производителями, а также привлечь интерес к индустрии в целом как со стороны детей и их родителей, так и со стороны экспертного сообщества.</p></div>'\n  }\n]\n\nexport default VeinBox;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/VeinBox.js\n **/","'use strict'\n\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nexport default class VeinLogo extends Component {\n\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"vein-logo\">\n        <a href=\"#\">\n          <img src=\"/images/logo.svg\" />\n          VeinTechnologies\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default VeinLogo;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/components/VeinLogo.js\n **/","'use strict'\n\nconst body = document.getElementById('body');\n\n\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport Scroll from 'react-scroll';\nconst Link = Scroll.Link;\nvar Element  = Scroll.Element;\nvar Events  = Scroll.Events;\nimport VeinServicesList from './VeinServicesList';\n\nexport default class VeinPortfolioList extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { title: null, description: null, popupIsClosed: true };\n  }\n  handleClick (work) {\n    this.setState({\n      title: work.title,\n      description: work.description,\n      popupIsClosed: false\n    });\n\n    this.fixBody();\n  }\n  fixBody () {\n    const slide = document.getElementsByClassName('slide')[0];\n    body.classList.add('active');\n    slide.classList.add('active');\n  }\n  unFixBody () {\n    const slide = document.getElementsByClassName('slide')[0];\n    body.classList.remove('active');\n    slide.classList.remove('active');\n  }\n  handleClose () {\n    this.setState({\n      popupIsClosed: true\n    });\n\n    this.unFixBody();\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.setState({\n        title: null,\n        description: null\n      });\n    }, 200)\n  }\n  setDescription () {\n    return { __html: this.state.description.toString() };\n  }\n  setTitle () {\n    return { __html: this.state.title.toString() };\n  }\n  renderPopup () {\n    if (!this.state.description) return\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={ this.handleClose.bind(this) }>Закрыть</button>\n        <h1>{ this.state.title }</h1>\n        <div className=\"description\" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={ this.setDescription() } />\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"main-content\">\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n          <div className=\"vein-logo\">\n            <a href=\"#\">\n              <img src=\"/images/logo.svg\" />\n              <span className=\"accent\">Vein</span>\n              <span>Technologies</span>\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <Link to=\"contacts\" smooth={true} className=\"contacts-button\">Контакты</Link>\n          <section className=\"about-section\">\n            <h1>\n              <p>VeinTechnologies&nbsp;&mdash;
